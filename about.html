        Hello! My name is Tal, and I am a professional originally from Israel, now based in Portugal. </br>
        A year ago, I moved here to embrace a more peaceful and balanced lifestyle, inspired by the country's beauty and culture.
        My background is in architecture, where I have a decade of experience managing diverse residential, commercial, and urban projects.
        I have led projects of various scales, working with multidisciplinary teams and consultants to deliver innovative and functional designs.
        Additionally, I have trained new employees, integrated new programs, and driven efficiency as a Revit professional.
        </br>       
        Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in creating compelling presentations, conducting in-depth research, and clearly presenting information to clients and team members.
        My ability to adapt to new challenges and communicate effectively has been a key factor in my professional success.
        Since moving to Portugal, I’ve explored opportunities in the tech sector, including a role with Teleperformance, where I worked on AI training and quality assurance for a digital mapping company.
        This experience inspired me to pursue a career in technology.
        I am currently enrolled in a front-end development course with SheCodes, where I am building skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, alongside user interface design.
      </p>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>
        I hold an accessibility certificate, which has deepened my understanding of the importance of designing for people with disabilities.
        I’ve learned that accessibility benefits everyone, and this perspective gives me an edge in creating web solutions that are more inclusive and user-friendly.</br>
        While I am not yet fluent in Portuguese, I am actively improving my language skills and manage well in daily interactions.
        Outside of work and studies, I enjoy gardening, exploring new cuisines, and embracing the slower pace of life in Portugal.
        I am seeking a junior position in front-end development or a related tech role, where I can apply my skills, grow within a team, and contribute to creating solutions that make a positive impact.
