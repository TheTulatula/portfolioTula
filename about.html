        Hello! My name is Tal, I am an Israeli-born professional having been in Portugal for some time now. </br>
        I moved here A year ago, trying to embrace a more peaceful and balanced lifestyle that the country has to offer.
        My professional background is in architecture, where I have spent a decade managing a variety of residential, commercial, and urban projects. 
        I’ve led projects of different sizes, collaborating with multidisciplinary teams and consultants to create innovative and functional designs. 
        Throughout my career, I’ve developed strong skills in crafting engaging presentations, conducting thorough research, and effectively communicating information to clients and team members. 
        My adaptability and communication skills have been crucial to my success in the field.
      </br>Since moving to Portugal, I’ve explored opportunities in the tech sector, including a role with Teleperformance, where I worked on AI training and quality assurance for a digital mapping company.
        This experience sparked my interest in pursuing a career in technology.
      Currently, I’m enrolled in a front-end development course with SheCodes, where I’m learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with user interface design.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>
       I also hold a certificate in accessibility, which has enhanced my understanding of the importance of designing for individuals with disabilities. 
       I’ve come to realize that accessibility is beneficial for everyone, and this insight helps me create web solutions that are more inclusive and user-friendly.</br>
        While I am not yet fluent in Portuguese, I am actively improving my language skills and manage daily interactions quite well.
        Outside of work and studies, I enjoy gardening, exploring new cuisines, and embracing the slower pace of life in Portugal.
        I am seeking a junior position in front-end development or a related tech role, where I can apply my skills, grow within a team, and contribute to creating solutions that make a positive impact.
